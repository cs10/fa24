## Submission Guidelines 
To run the PrairieLearn autograder, you'll need to submit models.py and board.py to the assignment titled *Pyturis* on **PrairieLearn**. You can either submit these filed individually or submit the entire project folder to the PL assignment, as irrelevant files will be filtered and not processed automatically. 

## Introduction

### Brief 

![Testcases for Part 1 Block](/fa24/assets/images/p2/P2-Part1Tests.png)

In this project, youâ€™ll code the game Tetris in Python, with the Turtle library rendering the graphical user interface (GUI). Python + Turtle + Tetris = Pyturis! This game involves fitting blocks called â€œpytrominoes'' together to fill and clear horizontal lines.
When youâ€™ve correctly implemented all the required functions, youâ€™ll be able to play Pyturis on a screen that looks like the one to the right.

### Preliminaries

Youâ€™ll need to have watched the Python lectures to complete this project. We also highly recommend completing Lab 13: Intro to Python before starting this project to get acquainted with Python and a text editor. Lab 14: Lists + Mutability and Lab 15: Data Structures in Python may help your understanding of how to use lists in Python, and Lab 16: OOP in Python offers a helpful tutorial with object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, which is the basis of this project.


**We require you to complete this project with a partner. **

### Goal 

The goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for practicing working with object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python by building a practical program with a structure that mimics real-world projects. In this project, youâ€™ll:
- practice working with row-major order (a common model for board structures, similar to the new 4x4 board with values block you used in Project 3)
- learn how to implement and work on either side of an abstraction barrier
- become familiar with using and extending an existing codebase rather than starting from scratch

### TODO 

All of the files youâ€™ll need to implement are marked in the files with TODO: your solution here, which you can search for with CTRL+F when you open the starter code in your preferred text editor. You can play a few games of [Tetris](https://tetris.com/games-content/play-tetris-content/index-mobile.php#google_vignette) here, or read [this additional section](#appendix:-pyturis-game-rules) of the spec to become familiar with the game rules. If youâ€™re writing more than 10 lines of code for any function, we recommend you consider other ways to achieve what youâ€™re trying to do, or take a break and head to OH for assistance!

## Feedback Form 
Congratulations on finish your first project in CS10ðŸ¥³. Please spend some time completing this [feedback form](https://forms.gle/R7bYuwgrPRHtd3ca6). This will be worth 1 point of your project grade. Thank you!
