# Labs

Labs are an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned in lecture in code (and other forms). All labs have a conceptual and a coding component. All labs assignments must be uploaded and autograded using Gradescope; the Gradescope link can be found on the worksheet.

The worksheeks linked below are high-level overviews and can be seen as a set of instructions for lab. Each worksheet lists all the required blocks, functions, or tasks for a particular lab. The worksheets also contain some of the test cases used to grade the lab.

The workbook, which differs from the worksheet, is used as a step-by-step guide to complete each lab.
