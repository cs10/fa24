Hi there! My name is Nicolas. I am a senior majoring in Enviormental Economics and Data Science. While I have not taken CS10, I have taken a variety of other technical courses here at Berkeley, aswell as been a software engineer intern this past summer that will help guide me in my teachings this semester. Fun facts about me, is that IN-N-Out is my favorite food, I love the Los Angeles Lakers, and my favorite place to be at is the beach!
