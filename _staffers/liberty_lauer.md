Hi! I'm Liberty, a sophomore from Washington state intending to major in Data Science and Economics. I had never coded before coming to Berkeley, but CS 10 kick-started a whole new journey for me. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing tennis, painting, hiking, trying different coffee shops, and traveling. I am excited for the opportunity to help you get a lot out of this course!
