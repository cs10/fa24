Hi everyone! My name is Vivek Putta and I am a sophomore in EECS, and I am so excited to get involved with CS10. This is my first time actually getting the opportunity to teach, and I am looking forward to learning and growing alongside all of you. I know we are going to have a great semester and I am excited to meet you all!
