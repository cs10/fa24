Hi there! My name is Stacey and I'm a current senior studying bioengineering. I took CS10 in Spring 2022 and have been with the team ever since. I"m excited to be back as Head TA this Fall. CS10 was a fun, welcoming introductory class that helped me confidently dive into the world of CS at Berkeley. Outside of the classroom I love to cook, listen to music, and create. Feel free to ask me anything! :D
