Hey! My name is Bryan and Iâ€™m a senior studying Computer Science & Data Science with a domain emphasis in Applied Mathematics and Modeling. As someone who started out with no programming experience before college, I felt that CS10 was perfect introduction for me back when I took it my freshmen year. I've since been an Academic Intern for CS10 for 3 semesters and am now a UCS1. During my free time, I will probably be watching Netflix or playing video games. I hope you enjoy CS10 and am looking forward to helping everyone as a UCS1!
