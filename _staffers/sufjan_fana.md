Hello :^) My name is Sufjan (Suhf-yawn), and I'm a rising senior studying Applied Math and Computer Science. I think CS 10 is an awesome course and the best way to build a foundation of love for computer science, along with the problem-solving abilities it provides. Aside from school, I'm really into film, politics, philosophy, and pretty much anything else that can be argued about as annoyingly and obnoxiously as possible.
