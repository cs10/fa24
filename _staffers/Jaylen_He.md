Hey what's up! My name is Jaylen and I'm a sophomore studying CS. Taking CS10 in my first semester at Berkeley really helped prepare me to enter the field here. From the strong course staff to the welcoming atmosphere, I loved everything about the class structure. For this, I felt I wanted to give back to help provide other students the same great experience I had when I took this class. Excited to meet you all and help teach this semester!
