Hi! I’m a senior studying Computer Science with an emphasis on Computer Architecture and EE. I took CS 10 back in Fall’21 and was an AI and tutor in the follwing years. CS 10 was one of my favorite courses, so I hope everyone will have fun while taking it! In my free time I like reading, crocheting and traveling :)
