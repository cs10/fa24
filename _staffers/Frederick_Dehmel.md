Hi, my name is Fredi! I took CS 10 in Fall 2023 and I am excited to work with you all this semester! I am from London and I am an sophomore studying Environmental Economics and Policy and Computer Science. I love to read, thrift and play basketball, and my favourite place to eat in Berkeley is Top Dog!
