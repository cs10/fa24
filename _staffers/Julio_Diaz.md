Hi everyone! I’m Julio, and I took CS10 in Fall 2023. This course was key in building my foundation in computer science, and I’m excited to be part of the CS10 staff this semester! I look forward to helping you navigate the material and supporting you throughout the course. Feel free to reach out anytime. Let’s make this a fun and productive semester together! :D
