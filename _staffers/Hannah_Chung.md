Hello! My name is Hannah and I am a sophomore studying Statistics. I've been a part of CS10 course staff since Spring 2024 and it has been a blast. I'm looking forward to bringing that same excitement to you this semester! In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, swimming, and playing with my foster kittens. Super excited to meet all of you!
