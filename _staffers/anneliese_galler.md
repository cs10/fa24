Hi! My name is Anneliese and I'm a sophomore majoring in Cognitive Science. I took CS10 in Spring 2024, which changed my life and helped me discover my passion for CS that I didn't know existed. I'm so excited to give back to CS10 by being an AI this semester! Outside of school I love to dance, learn languages, write creatively, and eat a lot of mac and cheese :D
