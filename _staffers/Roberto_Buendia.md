HAIIII GUYS :p I’m beyond excited to be your AI this semester! I'm from Santa Ana, CA and an Energy Engineering major with a minor in EECS, and let me tell you—coding is super hard man. When I started at Cal, I had zero coding experience, but this class opened soooo many doors for me. I can’t wait to help make your learning experience both fun and super enlightening. Let’s have an amazing semester together!
